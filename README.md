**RECURSION FREESTYLE**

**Author: Jimmy Song**

**Music Piece Description:**

This repo contains the music video and audio file for my song "Recursion Freestyle," with background music created through Sonic Pi and original lyrics created by me. The song is intended to be educational and provide a brief introduction to recursion in Computer Science. As you will see in the lyrics, it tells us what recursion is, brings up direct vs. indirect recursion, points out certain applications that often use recursion, and finally explains what makes up a recursive function. It strongly emphasizes the implementation of a base case, so as to not encounter INFINITE LOOPS. Regarding the beat itself, I took some influence from famous rapper Gunna, who often incorporates a melodic tune in his beats. The audio starts off with no drums or snare, just a simple melody, and then jumps into a looping 4-measure beat that layers drums, snares, and the original melody that I created. I hope you enjoy!


**Lyrics:**

If you wanna recurse,
You gotta prepare for the worst.
Take some advice from the best,
Then we put it to the test.

If you wanna recurse,
You gotta prepare for the worst.
Take some advice from the best (me),
Then we put it to the test.

(Let’s get it goin) what is recursion?
A function that calls on itself. (duh)
Wait that’s direct recursion,
It can also be indirect. (yuh)

What can you use it for?
Why should we learn some more?
Searching, sorting, backtracking, traversing,
Applications we know and adore.

Now how do we make this function?
There’s something to drill in your head (drill in your head).
Base cases are needed,
Repeat with me what I just said.

Base cases are needed,
PLEASE NO INFINITE LOOPS (no infinite loops)
Base cases are needed,
PLEASE NO INFINITE LOOPS (no infinite loops)

Base cases are needed,
PLEASE NO INFINITE LOOPS (no infinite loops)
Base cases are needed,
PLEASE NO INFINITE LOOPS

(All you need now) that’s the recursive case,
Breaks a large problem down.
This part- calls on itself,
We’ve finished the function now! (yuhhh)

If you wanna recurse,
You gotta prepare for the worst.
Take some advice from the best,
Then we put it to the test.

If you wanna recurse,
You gotta prepare for the worst.
Take some advice from the best (me),
Then we put it to the test.
